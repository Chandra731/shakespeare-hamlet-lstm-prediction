# shakespeare-hamlet-lstm-prediction
This project aims to build a next-word prediction system using an LSTM model. The model is trained on Shakespeare's Hamlet, providing predictions based on the language style of the text. A simple Streamlit app allows users to input a sentence, and the app predicts the next word in the sequence using the trained model.
